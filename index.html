    I'm a barista turned trainee programmer who decided to stick a pin in my passion for speciality coffee to start at Le Wagon and venture down new paths with the aim of some day doing something good for the world. I am an illustrator who works in partnership with a charity, and I hope to be able to advance its mission further with the skills I am currently developing. Owing to the pandemic, I have recently become a big advocate for mindfulness meditation, and I also love ducks and glass blowing factories. My most consumed snack is chickpeas straight from the can (owing far more to convenience than deliciousness).
